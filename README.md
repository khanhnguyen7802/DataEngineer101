# About 
This is my adventure of studying Data Engineer (following the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp by DataTalksClub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp)). <br>

❗Different weeks will have different folders particularly related to the content of that week. 

❗In each folder, you can find a **.md file** that demonstrates the content as well as the guideline of that week.
